# CryptoClustering
This is the module 19 challenge for data analytics bootcamp. Crypto_Clustering.ipynb has the main codes for this challenge, and the csv file is under Resources folder. 
All the comments and responses to questions are included in the Jupyter notebook. For this module, the best k value for the original data was 4, and still the same when we made clusters using principal component analysis. That said, using PCA helped to exclude outliers better and easily distinguish clusters.
